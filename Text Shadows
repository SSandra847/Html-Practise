	<h1>EDGAR ALLEN POE THE RAVEN</h1>
   <p> <em id="elephant">Once upon a midnight dreary,</em> while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    <em id="plesiosaur">While I nodded,</em> nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”
    </p>
    
	<p><em id="tourist">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;</em> 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore.
    </p>
    
    
	<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
            This it is and nothing more.”</p>
